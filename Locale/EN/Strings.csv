Bio Missiles cannot sustain much damage, and should be deployed with care. Bio War sections can be re-armed between combat rounds. It may be possible to upgrade the basic engine systems through research."
SECTIONDESC_CRBoarding,The section is designed to carry ship assault troops into battle. Once within range the troops board their assault pods and prepare to be launched against enemy large and huge starships.
SECTIONDESC_CRCloaking,"A complex system of sensor counter-measures and light masking renders a ship effectively invisible to opponents. Cloaked ships cannot be targeted directly, so care should be taken to avoid accidentally taking fire. As well, cloaked ships cannot fire while cloaked, though scientists believe they may be able to solve this problem with research."
SECTIONDESC_CRCommand,"The standard bridge section design."
SECTIONDESC_CRDeepScan,"Increases the sensor range and power of a ship, revealing cloaked vessels and planetary stats."
SECTIONDESC_CRDeepScanShield,"Shield Generator enhanced with Deep Scanners to reveal cloaked vessels and scan nearby space."
SECTIONDESC_CRDefencePlatform,"Large satellites are more expensive and take longer to produce, but provide four medium turrets and an additional four light turrets for outfitting. These satellites require a size 4 or larger world."
SECTIONDESC_CRDeflector,A deflector field generator diverts energy away from engines and uses that power to generate an electromagnetic field in front of a ship. This field attempts to deflect ballistic weapons and detonate tracking weapons before they reach the ship. The power taken from the engines causes a decrease in maneuvering speed.
SECTIONDESC_CRExtendedRange,"By trading weapons systems and hull armor for extra fuel capacity, Scout ships can strategically travel nearly three times as far as other ship designs, making them perfect for reconnaissance and exploration."

SECTIONDESC_CRFussionStutterWarp,The addition of a more powerful fusion power plant to the standard Stutter Warp improves the drives strategic range and speed.
SECTIONDESC_CRGate,"Each gatekeeper deployed increases the power of the network. Like all Gates, this ship must be kept safe for two years before the brethren reinforcements can arrive. It is larger and better armed than the weaker starship gates, but that also makes it a much bigger target."
SECTIONDESC_CRHammerHead,"This section is outfitted with additional weapons and improved maneuvering for better combat responsiveness."
SECTIONDESC_CRLongRangeFission,More efficient use of the Fission power plant gives Hiver ships a greater strategic range.
SECTIONDESC_CRLongRangeFusion,More efficient use of the Fusion power plant gives Hiver ships an even better strategic range.
SECTIONDESC_CRMineLayer,"A simple weapon, mines are deployed behind a moving minelayer, and can be used to break-up incoming fleets or protect vital targets. Scientists have no shortage of ideas for new mine payloads, but only time and research will tell if any of them are viable."
SECTIONDESC_CRMining,"The resources of unpopulated planets can be mined and transported to another planet, where they can provide a boost in production and overall resources. As expected, these ore carriers are very slow."
SECTIONDESC_CRNodeBore,"A specialized ship design to Rend holes in space time and tunnel through node space to create artificial node lines usable by Zuul vessels using their Rip drives. Larger and more efficient than the Rip Bore ship, the artificial node lines created by this vessel are still unstable and those created by this ship will last, on average, 65 years but may collapse sooner due to excessive usage. A fleet without a Rend Bore ship will be destroyed if a line collapses on it."
SECTIONDESC_CRAntimatterH-Node,"This drive system works on the same system improvements as "Harmonic Node Ring, Fusion", but the use of the more powerful Antimatter power plant provides the best combination strategy speed and range found in any engine design."
SECTIONDESC_CRFusionH-Node,"Harmonic Node Ring drive systems not only increase the strategy range of ships, but improves the node jump calculations greatly, allowing ships to travel along node lines much faster."

SECTIONDESC_CRScavenger,This section is designed to carry the Zuul slave disk and transport captured prisoners. It is light but durable as well. It has a capacity of 50 million slaves in cold storage.
SECTIONDESC_CRShield,"A shield generator produces a quantum field around the ship that blocks high-energy weapons. This field can be overwhelmed by too much incoming energy � to avoid a back surge to the engines, which would result, at the very least, in the destruction of the engine section, the shields will temporarily power-down and the system is reset. It may be possible to improve the field through research."
SECTIONDESC_CRSquadronCNC,"Standard CnC - can command 9 DE, or 3 CR, or 1 DN (more for Zuul)"

SECTIONDESC_DEArmadaCNC,"Advanced CnC - can command 27 starships, or 8 large, or 2 huge starships and change... (more for Zuul)"
SECTIONDESC_DEAssaultShuttle,"Often a small attack shuttle can be more effective at assaulting an enemy world than a ship in orbit. However the shuttles cannot sustain much damage, and should be deployed carefully � while they are away, their carrier ships should also be careful, so they can be there to pick the shuttles up after their attack run. It may be possible to upgrade the basic engine systems through research."
SECTIONDESC_DEBattle,A general-purpose combat section which provides a balanced mixture of standard weapons with flexible firing arcs.

SECTIONDESC_DEColony,"This section can carry a few dozen colonists and their supplies to a new world. Once ordered to colonize a world, colony ships land and their materials used in the initial set-up. Scientists believe it may be possible to increase the number of on-board colonists by up to five times through suspended animation, but more research will be required first."

SECTIONDESC_DEFusionStutterWarp,"By teleporting an entire ship an imperceptible distance, the Stutter Drive are an inertia-free drive system, limited only by the availability of power and the ability of the system to cycle."
SECTIONDESC_DEGate,"The Gatekeeper ships give the Hivers wings, allowing instant transport across the gate network. Each gate deployed increases the power of the network, allowing more ships to access the web at once. Deploying Gates takes time however, and must be kept safe for two years before the brethren reinforcements can arrive."
SECTIONDESC_DEHammerHead,"This section is outfitted with additional weapons and improved maneuvering for better combat responsiveness."

SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterFlickerWarp,The cycling computers in this drive section are so efficient in their control of stutter teleportation that it is possible for some enemy fire to pass through the ship.
SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterImpSW,More efficient use of the Stutter drive allows for an increase in movement near gravity wells.
SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterStutterWarp,"By teleporting an entire ship an imperceptible distance, the Stutter Drive are an inertia-free drive system, limited only by the availability of power and the ability of the system to cycle."
SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterWarp,"The ultimate hyper-drive design, improving the strategic and maneuvering speed of ships."
SECTIONDESC_DNArmadaCNC,"Advanced CnC - can command 27 stanard, or 8 large, or 2 huge starships and change... (more for Zuul)"
SECTIONDESC_DNArmour,A general-purpose combat section which provides a balanced mixture of standard weapons with flexible firing arcs.
SECTIONDESC_DNAssault,This section provides a mixed barrage of forward weapons fire. These weapons systems decrease a ship's thrust and turning power.
SECTIONDESC_DNBarrage,This section provides a mixed barrage of forward weapons fire. These weapons systems decrease a ship's thrust and turning power.
SECTIONDESC_DNBattleBridge,This section is primarily fitted for heavy combat beam weapons. These weapons systems decrease a ship's thrust and turning power.
SECTIONDESC_DNBioWar,"Through research, a variety of biological agents can be developed for war, but only one system can deliver them onto an enemy world. Bio Missiles cannot sustain much damage, and should be deployed with care. Bio War sections can be re-armed between combat rounds. It may be possible to upgrade the basic engine systems through research."
SECTIONDESC_DNCommand,"The basic bridge section in huge starship designs, this section provides an impressive amount of weapon banks at the least cost."
SECTIONDESC_DNDefencePlatform,"These are huge satellites which are a serious investment in time and resources, but they offer a formidable layer of protection for a planet of size 7 or larger."
SECTIONDESC_DNDeflector,A deflector field generator diverts energy away from engines and uses that power to generate an electromagnetic field in front of a ship. This field attempts to deflect ballistic weapons and detonate tracking weapons before they reach the ship. The power taken from the engines causes a decrease in maneuvering speed.
SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterR-Node,"Improvements to the focusing of the node drive provide an improvement to the strategic range of ships, as well as some improvement in maneuvering speed. The Antimatter engines give ships the best range out of all Resonant Node Ring equipped ships."
SECTIONDESC_DNFusionR-Node,"Improvements to the focusing of the node drive provide an improvement to the strategic range of ships, as well as some improvement in maneuvering speed. The use of a Fusion engine to power the node drive gives the ship a greater range than the "Resonant Node Ring, Fission" engines."
SECTIONDESC_DNFusion,"A marked improvement over Fission drives, Fusion drives provide a greater strategic range and maneuvering speed."
SECTIONDESC_DNFusionImpSW,The cycling computers in this drive section are so efficient in their control of stutter teleportation that it is possible for enemy fire to pass through the ship.
SECTIONDESC_DNFusionStutterwarp,The addition of a more powerful fusion power plant to the standard Stutter Warp improves the drives strategic range and speed.
SECTIONDESC_DNLongRangeFusion,More efficient use of the Fusion power plant gives Hiver ships an even better strategic range.
SECTIONDESC_DNNodeBore,"A specialized ship design to slice holes in space-time and tunnel through node space to create artificial node lines usable by Zuul vessels using their Rip drives. Larger and more efficient than the Rend Bore ship, the artificial node lines created by this vessel are still unstable and those created by this ship will last, on average, 95 years but may collapse sooner due to excessive usage. A fleet without a Radiant Bore ship will be destroyed if a line collapses on it."
SECTIONDESC_DNAntimatterH-Node,"This engine works on the same system improvements as "Harmonic Node Ring, Fusion", but the use of the more powerful Antimatter power plant provides the best combination strategy speed and range found in any engine design."
SECTIONDESC_DNFusionH-Node,"Harmonic Node Ring systems not only increase the strategy range of ships, but improves the node jump calculations greatly, allowing ships to travel along node lines much faster."
SECTIONDESC_DNProjector,The Huge version of the Artillery section is a heavily reinforced mission section dedicated to huge weapon mounts.
SECTIONDESC_DNSiegeDriver,"This gigantic mass accelerator uses asteroids to cause massive damage to big ships and planets. Well armed, but slow moving, the ship operates best with support ships."
SECTIONDESC_DNSquadronCNC,"Standard CnC - can command 9 DE, or 3 CR, or 1 DN (more for Zuul)"
SECTIONDESC_DNStrikeForceCNC,"Improved CnC - can command 15 DE, or 5 CR, or 1 DN (and change)... (more for Zuul)"
SECTIONDESC_DNTorpedoPlatform,"This variant of the large satellite sacrifices some large turret capability to make room for a devastating array of torpedo tubes. Requires a world of size 7 or more."
SECTIONDESC_DNWar,"The Boradside section is focused on heavy side-firing weapons to allow for devastating broadside attacks."

TUTORIAL_PAGE1_Title,Tutorial,
TUTORIAL_PAGE1_Text1,"\t\t\t This simple step-by-step walkthrough will introduce you to the basics of the game. The tutorial game is completely open for you to play around in and you can move through these tutorial pages as you like. However, if you added any AI to the game, better learn the basics sooner, rather than later, eh?\n\n",
TUTORIAL_PAGE1_Text2,"\t\t\t There are two parts to a game of Sword of the Stars � the strategy portion and the tactical combat portion. You are currently in the strategy portion of the game, where you control your empire.\n\n \t\t\t Tactical combat takes place when you bump into another player � when you do, you will be prompted for each fight you have. You select which ones you�d like to handle personally, and which ones you would like the game to fight on your behalf. If all combatants in a given fight choose AI, then the fight will be auto-resolved. Those fights you handle directly will begin and you will take command of your ships in real-time 3D combat!",

TUTORIAL_PAGE2_Title,Combat,
TUTORIAL_PAGE2_Text1,"\t\t\t Combat is easy � left click is used to select your own ships as well as set a ships target � where you click is where the ship will attempt to hit, so get sneaky! Try targeting a specific section, like a ship's engine or a weapon turret.\n\n\t\t\t Left click and drag will bandbox select multiple ships from your fleet. You can use Tab to jump between all your various ships. Right click will set the point to which you would like your ship or ships to move. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE2_Text2,\t\t\t Right click and hold will allow you to move your camera view around. The mouse wheel will zoom you in and out. And the third mouse button will lock the camera on a new target (very handy for picking those very specific targets.)\n\n
TUTORIAL_PAGE2_Text3,\t\t\t Those are the basics to getting into the action! It really is as simple as how you move your ship and where you shoot.\n\n
TUTORIAL_PAGE2_Text4,\t\t\t Let us have a look at the Strategy turn now.

TUTORIAL_PAGE3_Title,Strategy Screen
TUTORIAL_PAGE3_Text1,"\t\t\t In your first round, your homeworld is already selected. It is the planet with a Star marking it on the 3D starmap. All your colony worlds will be similarly marked with your player color, so it will be easy to see your empire as a whole whenever you are zoomed out. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE3_Text2,"\t\t\t Clicking a star or planet will select it � double clicking them will move the camera�s focus onto them. \n\n\t\t\tWhen you have selected one of your worlds, such as your homeworld, you can put it to work. "

TUTORIAL_PAGE4_Title,Research
TUTORIAL_PAGE4_Text1,"\t\t\t Click �Research� or �R�. The Research screen will appear � Here you can still see the different technology trees and their branches. Much like the Strategy map, your mouse controls your camera view � double clicking a technology icon will zoom in, revealing more information about that technology. Double clicking again will zoom back out.\n\n "
TUTORIAL_PAGE4_Text2,"\t\t\t Pick a technology and click to begin research � a progress bar and the number of years it should take to complete will appear. The higher up the tree the technology appears, the more it will take to research, and so it will take longer. As you can see on the top right, you can divert money away from savings and into research to speed things up.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE4_Text3,"\t\t\t Keep in mind that the tech tree in Sword of the Stars is dynamic � every time you start a new game, each player gets a tree with some randomly generated branches. The core technologies will always be there � you will always be able to build bigger, faster ships � but you cannot count on favorite weapons or technology always being there."

TUTORIAL_PAGE5_Title,Design
TUTORIAL_PAGE5_Text1,"\t\t\t Click �Design� or �D� and the ship design screen will appear. At the start of a game, you will have three standard starship designs prepared for you � Colonizers, Armors, and Tankers. \n\n\t\t\t There is one mission section available that is not part of any of the initial ship designs � Scout. Click the arrow buttons underneath the mission section until the Scout section appears or click the mission section name for a drop-down list of available sections.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE5_Text2,"\t\t\t As you progress through the game and more sections become available, you can mix and match the three ship sections � Bridge, Mission, and Engine � to suit your plans. You can even selected specific weapons for your designs using the weapons panel to the left.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE5_Text3,"\t\t\t Click �Confirm� to add this ship to your list of designs. You will be prompted to provide your design with a custom name, if you like � otherwise a default name will be assigned.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE5_Text4,\t\t\t Click the Exit button at the bottom right to return to the Strategy Screen.

TUTORIAL_PAGE6_Title,Build
TUTORIAL_PAGE6_Text1,"\t\t\t Click �Build� or �B� to access the ship building screen. All your available ship designs will be displayed on this screen. Select the ship design with the Scout section. Double click to add this design to the build queue. Repeat for any other combat starships and a colonizer starship as well. \n\n\t\t\t When you exit the screen you can go back at any time - even in subsequent years - to remove ships from the build queue, so long as they are still waiting for, or in the middle of, production."

TUTORIAL_PAGE7_Title,Moving
TUTORIAL_PAGE7_Text1,"\t\t\t Once you are ready to end the turn click �End Turn� at the bottom left. This will set building in motion and a new turn will begin. New ships will begin appearing every turn until your production orders are met. Once you have built ships, you can begin moving them around.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE7_Text2,"\t\t\t In the Strategy Screen, when you have a planet selected, like your home planet, you can see a list of all fleets stationed there. Click a fleet from the list, then click �Move� or �M�. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE7_Text3,"\t\t\t Move the mouse over a nearby star and a movement line will appear between it and your home planet � if any part of this line appears red, your fleet does not have to range to travel there without refueling. This is not a problem if you have a tanker with you to refuel ships along the way.\n\n\t\t\t Left click on a star to select it as the destination for your fleet or click on the starting planet to cancel. "

TUTORIAL_PAGE8_Title,Node Travel
TUTORIAL_PAGE8_Text1,"\t\t\t If you are playing Human or Hiver, how you move your fleets through the galaxy is unique.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE8_Text2,"\t\t\t Humans have developed a method of traveling between stars using space-time fractures, which they call Node Lines. Travel along these lines is extremely fast, but absolute. Human ships cannot refuel while traveling along node lines, so if any ships in a fleet do not have the range to cover the distance between two star systems, they will either have to find another route or a ship designed with greater range will have to take their place. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE8_Text3,"\t\t\t Human ships can travel off these Node Lines, but at slower-than-light speeds � this is usually reserved for desperate situations. At slower-than-light speeds human tankers can refuel in transit.\n\nThe Zuul also travel use Node drives, only they ""tunnel"" their own node lines rather than using natural lines as the Humans do. These lines must be maintained by sending Node boring ships across them from time to time, or they will collapse."

TUTORIAL_PAGE9_Title,Hiver Gates
TUTORIAL_PAGE9_Text1,"\t\t\t Hivers are a patient race and have never developed faster-than-light travel � they have however discovered a method of teleporting mass over great distances. Hiver fleets travel between systems at slower-than-light speeds, requiring a great many years to traverse � however once there, they can set up one of their teleport Gate ships and ships can travel to any other gate, anywhere in the galaxy, in a single turn.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE9_Text2,"\t\t\t As such, playing the Hiver means keeping two things in mind � the first is that Hiver fleets traveling to a new planet should always take a gate ship along. The second is that gate ships are a juicy target that enemies will always attempt to destroy, so guard them carefully! \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE9_Text3,"\t\t\t This web of gates has its limits � the amount of ships that can be moved around the gate system depends on the amount of active gates the player owns. Each deployed gate ship (special actions, such as deploying a gate ship, is explained in a later page) adds points to the gate network � the size of the network and how much of the traffic limit being used in a given turn is displayed at the top of the 3D map. "
TUTORIAL_PAGE9_Text4,\t\t\t Any planet with a deployed gate in-system will have a gate marker.

TUTORIAL_PAGE10_Title,Fleet Information
TUTORIAL_PAGE10_Text1,"\t\t\t Once you have given a move command and you end your turn, the fleet will move out. It may take a couple of years for them to reach their destination. This is good time to point out a few things about fleets. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE10_Text2,"\t\t\t When you select a fleet in transit or a planet with fleets stationed there, you will see to the left a list of every fleet, the ships in those fleets, where the fleet is moving to, how long it will take to get there, and to the right of each ship its fuel, range, and health status.\n\n\t\t\t It is important to note that when a ship�s health is orange, it has taken a notable amount of damage, but if it is red, then the ship has suffered serious damage resulting in the loss of a section. If that section is the engine section � you will know, because the fuel / range listings will read 0/0 - that ship will not be able to travel between star systems.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE10_Text3,"\t\t\t If you click on �Manage Fleets� or �F�, you�ll be able to drag and drop ships between fleets, or even into newly created fleets � later on, when you have developed command and control technology, you will be able to set the ships in to custom formations and squads."

TUTORIAL_PAGE11_Title,Planet Info
TUTORIAL_PAGE11_Text1,"\t\t\t Once you arrive at a planet, you will learn some information about it � its name, climate hazard, size, available resources, as well as information about its economic viability � when you colonize a planet, you will have control of that economy and its development.\n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE11_Text2,"\t\t\t Climate hazards are different for each race in each game, so some games you may find yourself competing with another race for certain planets. In others you may not have to compete for them at all � which is not always as good as it sounds! \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE11_Text3,"\t\t\t Regardless, any planet with a climate value plus or minus 500 off your perfect climate, you can colonize and terraform, though the worse the planet, the more expensive it is to transform. Anything past 500 and you cannot do anything with it � certain technologies can increase your terraforming abilities so you can deal with worse planets, but there will always be some that are just uninhabitable."

TUTORIAL_PAGE12_Title,Colonizing
TUTORIAL_PAGE12_Text1,"\t\t\t If you have a colonizer at a planet within your ability to terraform, you can click Special, and select Colonize. Once you end your turn and the new turn begins, you will have colonized the planet � new information and controls will appear, allowing you to tweak how you wish to develop the planet. \n\n"
TUTORIAL_PAGE12_Text2,"\t\t\t New colonies are vulnerable, so you should be prepared to protect them - as you will have to build up the infrastructure and population before they can efficiently produce new ships, building guard ships at another planet and then sending them to the new colony is not a bad idea."

TUTORIAL_PAGE13_Title,Special Functions
TUTORIAL_PAGE13_Text1,"\t\t\t There are a number of special abilities in the game � repair ships can fix damaged ships, tankers can refuel nearby fleets and both can be set to auto-refuel other ships.\n\n\t\t\t You can also scuttle ships, order mining and refinery ships to begin operations, and the Hiver race can deploy their star spanning Gate ships. If you ever change your mind and wish to cancel an order, most of these special functions can be stopped or started through this drop-down menu. Keep in mind that once you commit to your turn, there is no going back on scuttled ships. Just as important is that even before you commit to your turn, refueling or repairs are finalized once you leave their pop-up windows.\n\n\t\t\t Planets can refuel ships automatically, but have to be directed to repair ships, the same as a repair ship - just how much damage they can repair depends on the output of the planet."

TUTORIAL_PAGE14_Title,Final Notes
TUTORIAL_PAGE14_Text1,"\t\t\t Sword of the Stars is a deep and challenging game, but it is designed to be as accessible as possible. While not every aspect of the game is covered in this tutorial, the functions of everything in the game should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the genre and easy to experiment with for anyone who is not.\n\n"

AIDIP_ZUUL_CEASEFIRE_BREAK2,We have gotten what we need... now we come for you again.
AIDIP_ZUUL_CEASEFIRE_OTHER_BREAK1,You are quite mad.
AIDIP_ZUUL_CEASEFIRE_OTHER_BREAK2,Will you live long enough to regret this?
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_WAR1,You are barely worth devouring.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_WAR2,"Fear not, your minds will live on inside us long after your bodies break."
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_CEASEFIRE1,We cannot decide your fate.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_CEASEFIRE2,You give us pause.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_NONAGGRO1,You may become relevant someday.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_NONAGGRO2,We find ourselves confused as to your fate.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_ALLIANCE1,You no longer smell of meat.
AIDIP_ZUUL_DISPOSITION_ALLIANCE2,You remind us of father.

AIDIP_MORRIGI_NONAGGRO_ACCEPT1,"Yes, peace is profit."

AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_REQUEST1,Let us stop killing each other�s explorers.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_REQUEST2,These petty deaths must end.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_ACCEPT1,"Very well, we will stay away from each other's nests."
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_ACCEPT2,This is wise. Deep space belongs to both of our peoples.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_REJECT1,No! You must be eliminated as a threat.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_REJECT2,"No, you have more painful lessons to learn."
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_BREAK1,We return war to you!
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_BREAK2,Peace of any kind is non-viable with you.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_OTHER_BREAK1,Do you realize how this will end?
AIDIP_MORRIGI_CEASEFIRE_OTHER_BREAK2,So you have chosen the monsters path.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_DISPOSITION_WAR1,You are Zuligi!
AIDIP_MORRIGI_DISPOSITION_WAR2,While you exist there is danger.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_DISPOSITION_CEASEFIRE1,The clans cannot decide about you.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_DISPOSITION_CEASEFIRE2,We are interested in improving relations.
AIDIP_MORRIGI_DISPOSITION_NONAGGRO1,You are worthy to share profits with.

TECHNAME_DRV_OvrThrust,Overthrusting
TECHDESC_DRV_OvrThrust,The development of the oscillation overthruster allows for the venting of drive plasmas through advanced MHD compressors for extra thrust and speed. The potential also exists for non-drive venting races to use this effect as a power amplifier.
TECHNAME_DRN_Auto,Autonomous Drones
TECHDESC_DRN_Auto,A set of AI routines that allow a drone to function without control or user input for many years at a time. The Morrigi use this technology to create ships that can set colony and asteroid traps. The vessel is consumed in the construction of the trap system.
TECHNAME_DRN_AdvFrm,Advanced Drone Frames
TECHDESC_DRN_AdvFrm,"This technology allows for the creation of more robust drone frames, power systems and control surfaces, which results in the ability to support larger weapon loadouts and more robust attack systems. This gives an Empire the ability to build larger, more advanced drones."
TECHNAME_DRV_Ints,Interceptor Missiles
TECHDESC_DRV_Ints,"Advancements in micro-missile tech as well as in high-speed tracking and vector calculation allows for the creation of point defense missiles capable of engaging drones, guided torpedoes and mines. Other missiles remain too hard to vector against accurately and so Interceptors will NOT engage other missile ordnance."
TECHNAME_WEP_PulGrvBm,Pulsed Graviton Beam
TECHDESC_WEP_PulGrvBm,A refinement of the standard graviton beam that adds an oscillating gravimetric pulse to the beam which induce brutal shockwaves into the target. Resonating waves can get so strong it can result in catastrophic structure failures in systems like Turret Connections.
TECHNAME_WEP_AccAmp,Accelerator Ampilification
TECHDESC_WEP_AccAmp,Breakthroughs in superconductors allows a boost in ballistic round veloicity thus increasing damage output of all new and existing ballistic weapons.
TECHNAME_WEP_RailGun,Rail Guns
TECHDESC_WEP_RailGun,Taking further advantage of accelerator amplification technology this enables extremely large rail gun cannons to be affixed to a new ship model offering devastating damage from extreme range.
TECHNAME_WEP_PolPlsm,Polarized Plasmatics
TECHDESC_WEP_PolPlsm,"This focusing technology allows for the creation of weaponized plasma forms, which are polarized to �spin� along a horizontal axis. The result plasma focuses its thermal release along a very narrow plane upon contact with the target and achieves a �slicing� effect that defeats ship armor. This weapon has been nicknamed the �War Quoit� by human ship crews."
TECHNAME_WEP_PolFus,Polarized Fusion
TECHDESC_WEP_PolFus,The polarized fusion cannon is the advancement of polarized plasmatics into the fusion era resulting in longer range and heavier hitting power while still retaining the ability to cut through armor plating as if it were not there.
TECHNAME_WEP_PolAm,Polarized Antimatter
TECHDESC_WEP_PolAm,"The upscaled polarized plasmatic weapon for use at antimatter power levels. Damage is increased, along with overall effective range."
TECHNAME_WEP_IntCan,Inertial Cannon
TECHDESC_WEP_IntCan,"Deeper understanding of field physics allows the projection of contained fields that induce a temporary shift in the targets acceleration vs. inertia ratio. The result is a small reduction in the target�s speed that slowly fades over time. Multiple hits by this weapon increases the effect. While the inertial field does no contact damage per se, the stress of the inertial shift does damage the target vessel�s support structure."
TECHNAME_WEP_HvyIntCan,Heavy Inertial Cannon
TECHDESC_WEP_HvyIntCan,A heavy barrel triple pulse version of the Inertial Cannon
TECHNAME_WEP_KelTrp,Kelvinic Torpedoes
TECHDESC_WEP_KelTrp,Particle manipulation and field tech allows for this torpedo capable of draining a target of its molecular motion to the point of leaving it near absolute zero for a few moments. This not only causes surface stress damage to the hull of the target but also makes it more fragile and therefore it takes more damage from any kind of subsequent damage.
TECHNAME_WEP_HvyMsl,Heavy Missiles
TECHDESC_WEP_HvyMsl,"Heavy missiles offer a more robust and expensive version of the standard missile. It packs a larger warhead and travels somewhat slower but is much more heavily armored than the standard version. In addtition, it will automatically select a new target if its current target is destroyed before impact."
TECHNAME_WEP_HvyPMsl,Heavy Planetary Missiles
TECHDESC_WEP_HvyPMsl,"Once researched, planets can fire one Heavy Missiles for every 200 million population, rounding up. In addtition, it will automatically select a new target if its current target is destroyed before impact."
TECHNAME_WEP_MWPMsl,Multi-Warhead Planetary Missiles
TECHDESC_WEP_MWPMsl,"Once researched, planets will automatically fire these."
TECHNAME_SLD_Focus,Shield Focusing
TECHDESC_SLD_Focus,"This tech combines the shield projector with the Liirian flicker warp technology to project a single shield over multiple targets millions of times per second, making it appear as if each ship had its own complete shield. "
TECHNAME_IND_AstMon,Monitor Construction
TECHDESC_IND_AstMon,Advances in both asteroid mining and deep space construction allows for the hollowing out of large asteroids to recreate some of the power and function of the ancient Morrigi Asteroid monitors. Construction of new asteroid monitors requires a deep space constructor ship and the system in which they are being built MUST have an asteroid belt.
TECHNAME_CCC_ScanSats,Scanner Satellites
TECHDESC_CCC_ScanSats,"Adaptations of deep scan technology allows for smaller, short range variants designed to provide limited tactical scan capability versus cloaked targets entering planetary bombardment range."
TECHNAME_DRN_Sats,Drone Satellites
TECHDESC_DRN_Sats,Engineering upgrades to standard defense satellite tech allows for the launching and re-arming of Drones from medium and large specialized satellites.
TECHNAME_DRN_BtlRdrs,Battle Riders
TECHDESC_DRN_BtlRdrs,"Advancements in huge starship engineering have allowed our engineers to create a design which can carry three specialized starships into combat. These 'riders' are larger than destroyers, but not as large as cruisers. However, since these ships have no need of FTL drives of their own, they are heavily weaponized and carry a great deal of firepower indeed!"

SECTIONDESC_DEPursuit,A booster section designed to increase a ship's thrust and top speed significantly at the cost of heavier firepower.
SECTIONDESC_DEColonyTrickster,This ship is designed to lay a Morrigi colony trap at any uninhabited world. It is consumed in the construction of the trap facility.
SECTIONDESC_DEBeltTrickster,This ship is designed to lay a Morrigi asteroid belt gravity trap in any uninhabited system that contains an asteroid belt. It is consumed in the construction of the trap facility.
SECTIONDESC__AssaultShuttle_Advanced,"This more advanced version of the planetary assault shuttle is more durable, does more damage on its planetary attack runs and carries a space capable turret mount."
SECTIONDESC__DroneHeavy,This more robust version of the standard attack drone is slower but carries more armor and firepower.
SECTIONDESC__DroneBomber,This more robust version of the standard attack drone is slower but carries a single mini-torpedo mount to bombard targets at range.

SECTIONDESC_CRImpactor,This mission section is designed to carry the powerful ballistic Rail Cannon into combat and is best employed at long range.
SECTIONDESC_DNImpactor,This mission section is dedicated to the rail cannon weapon system and brings to bear a devastating battery of long range heavy ballistic fire from multiple cannon emplacements.
SECTIONDESC_CRBlazer,"This section is dedicated completely to heavy combat beams. While it is designed to deliver a devastating anti-capital ship attack, the intense power demands means a reduction in other turret based weapon systems."
SECTIONDESC_DNBlazer,"This section is dedicated completely to heavy combat beams. While it is designed to deliver a devastating anti-capital ship attack, the intense power demands means a reduction in heavy turret based weapon systems."
SECTIONDESC_DEStrafe,"Advancements in construction techniques have allowed engineers to support standard weapons in a direct fire mount. Without the bulky turret systems, a command section can now mount more light weapons but only in forward directed mounts which lends itself to high speed strafing attacks by captains."
SECTIONDESC_CRStrafe,"Advancements in construction techniques have allowed engineers to support standard weapons in a direct fire mount. Without the bulky turret systems, a command section can now mount more medium weapons but only in forward directed mounts which lends itself to high speed strafing attacks by captains."
SECTIONDESC_CRProtectorate,"This advanced shield projector section can surround nearby smaller starships with their own complete shield. Warning: Should any shielded ship get too far away from the protectorate unit, its shield will drop."
SECTIONDESC_DNProtectorate,"This advanced shield projector section can surround nearby smaller starships with their own complete Shield. Warning: Should any shielded ship get too far away from the protectorate unit, its shield will drop."
SECTIONDESC__AsteroidMonitor,"The Neo-Monitor is smaller and less heavily armoured than the ancient Morrigi Asteroid bases they were adapted from, but it does allow for the placement of modern weapons."
SECTIONDESC_CRDeepscanPlatform,This satellite will scan for cloaked ships at relatively close ranges in tactical combat. This sat possesses NO strategic map scan ability.
SECTIONDESC_CRDronePlatform,This medium satellite is designed to support combat drones in the planetary defense role.
SECTIONDESC_DNDronePlatform,This large satellite is designed to support a squadron of combat drones in the planetary defense role.
SECTIONDESC__HunterShip_Fusion,This is the fusion era version of the Tark Hunter/Killer Rider. It is designed to be carried by a huge carrier starship.
SECTIONDESC__HunterShip_Antimatter,"This is the antimatter era version of the Tark Hunter/Killer Rider. It is faster, better armed and armored than the fusion era version. It is designed to be carried by a huge carrier."
SECTIONDESC_DNCarrier,This huge starship section carries the Tarkan Hunter Ship. It is designed to carry 3 Hunter/Killer Riders between the stars and into combat.
SECTIONDESC_DNSupport,"This advanced huge starship section is designed to support an entire fleet with its extensive repair, salvage, refinery, and refueling systems."

SECTIONDESC_DNCOL,This huge starship section packs multiple COL tubes and is able to deliver a variety of complex ordnance into battle simultaneously.
SECTIONDESC_CRTerrorize,"This Zuul ship is designed to instil terror into the hearts of the enemy through non-stop transmitted psychological attacks. While it functions in an enemy system, that world will suffer serious drops in morale."
SECTIONDESC_CRPropaganda,"This cultural broadcast vessel is meant to beam vast amounts of carefully selected news and entertainment at target worlds. In its systems, a Propaganda vessel will raise morale. While in and enemy system it will lower the worlds morale. Propaganda vessels stationed in deep space near an enemy empire will slowly raise their opinion of you."
SECTIONDESC_DNSubjugator,This Zuul huge starship section can carry 4 slaver discs at a time and can carry 50 million slaves in cold storage.

SCENARIO_ANTIQUARIANS_DESC1,"\t\t\tWith the morning�s intelligence report it has become clear; the race is on.\n\n\t\t\tIt has been confirmed that enemy scientists have been thinking along the same lines as your own � the ruined, yet half-operational derelicts found from time to time, suggest a larger whole, and if enough of them can be found and collected, the thinkers believe they can put them back together again.\n\n\t\t\tImagine the possibilities of possessing a fully operational, exotic alien technology!\n\n\t\t\tHunt the derelicts down and bring them to the Homeworld for study. Do NOT let them fall into the hands of the other empires!\n\n"
